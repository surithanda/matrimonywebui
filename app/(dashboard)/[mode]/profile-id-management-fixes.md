# Profile ID Management - Fixed Issues

## Problem Analysis

The issue was that the console log "Layout component unmounting..." was being executed on both component load and unload. This happened because:

1. **useEffect Dependency Array Issue**: The `setSelectedProfileID` function was included in dependency arrays, causing cleanup functions to run whenever the function reference changed.

2. **Function Recreation**: The `setSelectedProfileID` function in the ProfileContext was being recreated on every render due to improper memoization.

3. **No Mount/Unmount Distinction**: There was no way to distinguish between component mounting and actual unmounting.

## Fixes Implemented

### 1. Fixed ProfileContext Function Memoization
**File**: `app/utils/useProfileContext.tsx`

```tsx
// Before - function recreated on every render
const value = useMemo(() => ({
  selectedProfileID,
  setSelectedProfileID
}), [selectedProfileID, setSelectedProfileID]);

// After - properly memoized function
const setSelectedProfileID = useCallback((id: number) => {
  setSelectedProfileIDState(id);
}, []);

const value = useMemo(() => ({
  selectedProfileID,
  setSelectedProfileID
}), [selectedProfileID, setSelectedProfileID]);
```

### 2. Removed Function from useEffect Dependencies
**File**: `app/(dashboard)/[mode]/layout.tsx`

```tsx
// Before - included setSelectedProfileID in dependencies
useEffect(() => {
  // ... component logic
}, [mode, isCreateMode, isUpdateMode, selectedProfileID, setSelectedProfileID]);

// After - removed setSelectedProfileID to prevent unnecessary re-runs
useEffect(() => {
  // ... component logic
}, [mode, isCreateMode, isUpdateMode, selectedProfileID]);
```

### 3. Added Mount/Unmount Detection
**File**: `app/(dashboard)/[mode]/layout.tsx`

```tsx
// Added mounting flag to distinguish between mount and unmount
const isMountingRef = useRef(true);

useEffect(() => {
  // Mark that the component has finished mounting
  isMountingRef.current = false;
  
  return () => {
    // Only log unmount if component was not mounting
    if (!isMountingRef.current) {
      console.log("Layout component unmounting...");
    }
    // ... cleanup logic
  };
}, []); // Empty dependency array - only runs on mount/unmount
```

### 4. Optimized Effect Dependencies

- **Mode handling effect**: Removed `setSelectedProfileID` from dependencies
- **Pathname monitoring effect**: Removed `setSelectedProfileID` from dependencies  
- **Unmount handling effect**: Used empty dependency array `[]` to only run on mount/unmount
- **SessionStorage recovery effect**: Used empty dependency array `[]` to only run once on mount

## Key Benefits

1. **No False Unmount Logs**: The unmount log now only appears during actual component unmounting
2. **Improved Performance**: Reduced unnecessary effect re-runs
3. **Stable Function References**: Memoized functions prevent cascading re-renders
4. **Cleaner Dependency Arrays**: Only essential dependencies included
5. **Better Debugging**: Clear distinction between mounting and unmounting phases

## Testing Verification

To verify the fixes work correctly:

1. **Component Mount**: No unmount log should appear when the component loads
2. **Navigation**: Unmount log should appear when navigating away from the route
3. **Mode Changes**: Profile ID backup/restore should work without triggering unmount logs
4. **Page Refresh**: SessionStorage fallback should work for profile ID restoration

## Code Quality Improvements

- **TypeScript Safety**: Maintained proper type safety throughout
- **React Best Practices**: Proper use of useCallback and useMemo
- **Clean Dependencies**: Removed unnecessary dependencies from useEffect
- **Debugging Support**: Enhanced logging for troubleshooting without noise

The implementation now correctly distinguishes between component mounting, updating, and unmounting phases, ensuring the profile ID management system works reliably without false positives in the logging system.
